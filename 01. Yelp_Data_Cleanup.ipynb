       "The best burger I have ever had.  I have been to In-N-Out burgers all over the place.  They are all excellent.  The burgers are so well seasoned, the burger is fresh and the fries top it off perfectly.  I think they don't need salt added, but some people think it helps.  They are much less expensive than my second favorite place and so much better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                4\n",

Their staff always setup the food in a very nice manner. All utensils, napkins, plates, etc are included in the pricing. And many people really rave about their baked zits which is always a staple in my catering orders. I will continue to utilize their catering services. Give these guys a shot if ur having a private event or need catering for your next work function.

Considering it's in Vegas I wished pricing and food were competitive to the major casinos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2\n",
       "Been coming here for 10+ years...This place has become a complete disappointment. Total Rewards chain of Buffets has completely downgraded their quality of food and service. Bought our 24hr buffet as usual, 1st surprise was at Carnival World Buffet at The RIO, they no longer have a stir fry station, the quality of food is a total downgrade, stations are reduced and food really sucks! Next day we headed out to Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood... Surprise again! No omelette station!!! REALLY???? That's the bare minimum standard for a brunch place!!! Mimosas are 1 per person! Oh boy, would have been nice if they told me this before I paid $75!!! YOU GUYS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES !!!\\nStop trying to make an extra buck on your clients and at least be honest and upfront about your less than acceptable service. \\nI for sure will NEVER COME BACK! People, please don't waste your money here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n",
       "AMAZING BEYOND WORDS.... I will admit that it has taken me longer than it should have to eat at the Market Grille Cafe, and I am sorry it took so long.  Describing the food as incredible just does not do it enough justice.  There are very few places that I have eaten at over my 40+ years that serve food that has so much depth of flavor.  \\n\\nI started with the pumpkin mushroom soup and honestly, I could have just eaten that all day long.  Quite possibly the best soup I have ever had.  I then moved into the entree where I had the pomogranate chicken and it about knocked me out of my chair.  The chicken was so tender, moist and the flavor was intoxicating.  I honestly could have eaten like 10 chicken breasts cooked this way.  Wow, what an amazing treat.  Then to finish off the experience I had the baklava cheesecake.  I was told that this dessert won an award at a food competition and I do not doubt it at all.  It was as lucious as it gets.  What an amazing way to finish.  The experience was basically a food orgasm.  \\n\\nThe Market Grille Cafe is a family owned business with two locations in town and the service and hospitality of ALL of the people that work there is just as impressive as the food.  The MGC has it all, atmosphere, hospitality, and most importantly incredible food.  If that was not enough the prices for the food are as economically friendly as it can be.  The MGC is very wallet friendly.  I do not know how they do it for so little but they do. I spend just as much or more for fast food and do not get anything close to this in quality.  \\n\\nI am a huge Gyro fan so my next visit I am definitely going to try one.  I saw someone else having one and asked how it was and they said it was outstanding and the best they ever had.  I cannot say I am surprised.  \\n\\nI urge all of my Yelpers out there to visit the Market Grille Cafe and enjoy the same amazing experience I had.  \\n\\nRun, don't walk and get yourself into the Market Grille Cafe.    2\n",
       "FOOD POISIONING WARNING We went for \"prime rib\" night. The food selection was so small. The staff that served the meat yelled at someone \"what do you want? Pick what you want!\" But that is not why I am giving it such a low score. My husband got food poisioning from the chicken in the Italian section he saw that it was pink so he stopped eating it but that ruined our whole trip. Having to stay in our hotel room because he couldn't leave the bed. Way to go Fremont hotel.

       "In Vegas visiting family. My father in law ordered delivery from this place. I was very pleased with the Pizza, salad(the one with pears in it), and the huge manicotti dish.

Sweet potato fries and a Matcha iced tea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",
       "Little known fact, there are very few things I love more than breakfast. So for obvious reasons it was on the top of my very long list bookmarks. A word to the wise, come early and come hungry! There will be a wait but it's worth it. Better than the cracked egg, the egg & I, egg works...basically anyplace with the word egg in it. Lol! (IMO anyway) :p \\n\\nFriendly staff and lots of Hawaiian inspired dishes. I just love the aloha vibe here which makes sense since Vegas is the 9th island. Zippy's chili (If you've been to HI before then you already know what I'm taking about), portuguese sausage with garlic rice, macadamia pancakes, spam & eggs, adobo fried rice omelette, and the list goes on. It's easy to see why baby stacks stands out from the pack. So Ono! \\n\\nAnother notable mention are the red velvet pancakes. But my all time favorite are the bananas foster pancakes. OMG!!!

       "Hands down, the best Italian food I've ever had.  I feel like no one would ever expect a restaurant that's open 24 hours to have food that is this high quality.

You all should to try it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       2\n",
       "Craft steak was flawless in every way.  I arrived with my party about 10 mins early just in case there was a wait.  As I sat there I noticed the interior, perfectly classic steak house, wood everything.  Dark oaks, redwoods and even pine.  Aw the faint smell of wood finish is unmistakable and wonderful when you sit down to a hearty meal.  There is just something about the smell of pine and oak that goes with a 12oz steak.\\n\\nOur server came over to us promptly and introduced himself.  Charm filled the room, every wait staff had a smile ear to ear.   The Floor manager came over next.  We were all dressed in business attire and casual wear, nothing special at all.  After all it was 110 degrees outside so some of us were in shorts.  None of this stopped him from coming over.   He just came over to introduce himself and make sure everything was to our liking. \\n\\nWe started our meal with artisan breads. The favorite of the table was the kalamata rosemary bread. Wonderfully salty and airy, perfect way to get us to drink 2 more cocktails each.  A good restaurateur will understand the need to up sale through cocktails and a good way to do that is salty snacks,\\n\\nI had the New York strip with Natural Ju and Thyme.   It came sliced into perfect  inch cubes with a  inch fat cap still attached.  All I could think was thank god you kept the fat on there.  I got a side of roasted mushrooms with my steak. I'm a sucker when it comes to mushrooms, especially when they are prepared as simple as possible. They were simply pan roasted in clarified..... also known as liquid gold.\\n\\nAll in All for experience, atmosphere, food and service they get a 5, but when I go into a place like this I expect nothing less then a perfect evening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",

I would not recommend this buffet at all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               2\n",
       "Everything is just perfect! I've never tried any Korean food as good as these. We almost gave up while waiting. Thankfully we returned and enjoyed our meal.

       "We've been in Vegas for two nights and we've already eaten here three times. \\n\\nThis is an absolute excellent place in the Venetian that's open late (maybe even 24 hours) and has an expansive menu that's got something for everyone. The food is pretty high quality and fairly priced. \\n\\nWe're always seated quickly and served immediately. The service is always friendly and cordial. \\n\\nTonight, we came here after a horrible experience at Homestead Steakhouse at Ceaser's (don't go there if you want steak, ever) and we were satisfied, just as we were the past two visits. \\n\\nI'm on a no-carb diet and they were accommodating every time. I ordered a burger with no bun and they even wrapped it in lettuce for me! Same with the chicken sandwich, which was phenomenal. Plus, they've got a great happy hour menu! \\n\\nAt the Grand Lux, you get pretty damn good food at a low price. With all the places to eat in Vegas, it's gotta say *something* that we've eaten at least three meals here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  2\n",
       "First time I ordered, didn't deliver one of my items, also asked on the phone when ordering for the delivery guy to be able to break a $100, only breaks it into $20s, causing an awkward tipping situation.\\n\\nNext time I ordered we were really sick in the room and the point of delivery was to not leave the room. Lazy delivery guy calls and insists I come down to get it that he wouldn't be able to because of security (which is crap, we ordered at the same time last time), and I tell him I'm not feeling well and the point of delivery was to not leave the room, but he insists, completely defeating the purpose. I could have just gone downstairs. Says 5 mins, leaves me waiting downstairs looking and feeling like crap in public for 20.\\nOh, and there was no security, so he could have come up no problem.\\n\\nOh, AND when ordering, mentioned the missing item from last time and they neither refunded me the difference or offered a \"free\" item to make up for the $5 they effectively stole. She just commented that there's no note on my file - and I said because I intended on ordering again and was just going to mention it now since it's not like they're going to make a trip back just for missed dessert. (Second order was only a couple days after the first.)\\n\\nAbout the actual food - cheese pizza is really good, other pizza we had with mushrooms wasn't good, and caesar salad is an awful waste of money (really stale croutons were gross).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         2\n",

We will definitely be back for more.  \\nThank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   2\n",

       "One of the best seafood spots in Vegas in my opinion. The service is, mediocre. At best. But there's really nothing better than tearing into some crab with your friends while drinking a beer. \\n\\nWe started off with the calamari, it was tough and chewy. The battering was great, but the calamari itself tastes terrible and had a bad consistency. I think they have some of the best fried shrimp in Vegas! Great taste and ask to have some hot n juicy spicy on the side for dipping the shrimp and everything else! \\n\\nThe snow crab and shrimp were by far the star of the show for me. The shrimp was soooooo good. Firm and delicious, and much easier to peel open than the ones I've had a the other Cajun spots in Vegas. The snow crab was huge and really amazing in flavor. Full of meat and easy to crack open. I asked for a second order of snow crab with no sauce because I loved the taste of the crab and liked to dip it myself into a side of sauce. Don't forget to order corn and potato in the bag!\\n\\nOverall, this has to be my favorite Cajun spot in Vegas, by far! Great restaurant to come to with the family and get messy! Great seafood, great experience, and great sauces!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        2\n",

       "Wifi worked good in our room , ac was good but it was right next to our bed. Room was wide but restroom was small and horrible and not enough toilet paper. No mini fridge and ice machine didn't work the whole time we were there. TV channels lame. Casino smelled like smoke through out the building. Hallways and elevator didn't even have AC. Free shuttle to strip and plenty of parking at the hotel.

       "Started going to Wahoo's this football season when Shannon started tending bar there. \\n\\n Shannon, and I go way back and watching football with her is tradition. Nevertheless, I really like the place. The bar has a nice atmosphere, the crowd is cool, the price is right, great specials, and Shannon puts on the Lions games for us, and I can also watch other games and keep up with my fantasy football points. \\n\\nI haven't eaten much other than the wings, but I get them every time. They are awesome and have a really nice flavor to them. \\n\\nIt goes without saying that Shannon is one of the best, fastest, knowledgeable and personable Bartenders I've ever had the pleasure of frequenting. Whether you know her or not she's a true professional and makes everyone feel welcomed and well taken care of. \\n\\nThis location is completely across town from where I live, but it's worth the trip.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
       "You had me at \"Mezcal Old Fashioned\". Also at \"tacos\". I have eaten here a few times and enjoyed each visit. The barbacoa, and al pastor tacos are usually my go-tos, and both are delicioso. Last time, I ordered the veggie taco, and it was so tasty that I considered ordering at least a dozen more even tho I wasn't even hungry enough for the first one. *Hunger is of no concern when tacos are involved. The mango jicama salad is fresh and tasty and they have a unique selection of draft beers which is fun for those who like to explore outside of the Corona bottle. And ultimately, the best part is getting to sit outside, eating and drinking and good-timing, on the patio just like the good 'ol FF days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "This small, about 12-seat Oyster Bar in an old casino north of the Strip called the Palace Station, definitely lives up to the hype. It is certainly an interesting dining concept in the middle of a sea of slot machines. I had a half dozen oysters and a half dozen clams and my partner had the Alaskan chowder, it was all fresh and delicious. Chowder had huge chunks of seafood, and was probably the best chowder I've ever tasted  \\n\\nWe definitely got lucky with the seating, as we went at about 7 a.m. on a Wednesday and we were the only ones there. I only wish we had more time and I could have tried other items on the menu, especially the $70 seafood special for 2, which we didn't notice on the digital display screen until after we ordered. Definitely will go back on our next visit to Vegas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",

       "So far, Q is the best private room karaoke I've found in Vegas. \\n\\nMuch as I'd like to keep it my secret, Q is really awesome, so I must share. Plus, only reviewing the poor and mediocre businesses is a sure path to idiocracy. \\n\\nQ has such great deals, I don't know how they stay in business. Mon-Thur is half price off room rentals all day. We went on a Thursday and got a medium room (accommodates 6-10 ppl), regular $25\\/ hr - we got it for $13 an hour. There was also a buy two get one free drink special. We ordered six carafes of yogurt soju at $15 a piece and only paid for four. \\n\\nFor three hours in a small room and six carafes of soju, we paid $92 before tip. After tip, it broke down to about $16 per person. What?! For three hours of karaoke?!\\n\\nDown side to Q is that their English song selection isn't great, but is pretty standard for Las Vegas (I think all the Asian-owned karaoke joints get their karaoke systems from the same company). If anyone knows of better karaoke places, please message me. I'll do the recon and review. \\n\\n(Please note that I'm reviewing Q under the standards of private room karaoke, as opposed to bar karaoke. While I do love bar karaoke, it's a different animal all together.) \\n\\nBut it looks like they're phasing in a new system. You have to pick either the new system OR the old, you can't have both. The new system looks like they might have a larger selection of English songs, but they're kind of old. If you want to jam down with some Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, and Maroon 5, go old system. If you want to sing some Pretenders, old Foo Fighters, go with the new. \\n\\nIf you hang around long enough, the host will come in, drop a fruit plate, and say, \"On the house.\" \\n\\nThey're pretty strict about bringing in outside food or drink. They wouldn't let my friend bring in a boba drink, even though Q doesn't sell boba drinks.                                                                                                       1\n",
       "First, food tasted great!! We started off with Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries and Bone Marrow Jam. Ordered fries coz I love oxtail and was curious. It was good but way more than we can finish. It's not a knock, just a warning that this is more of a large group app or for a meal unto itself. The marrow was absolutely divine! It was cooked to perfection served on the bone and you eat with little triangle toasts. I wanted more! \\n\\nFor my main course I had Kiki's Burger which featured specialty mushrooms. This is where I had to knock off a star. They ran out of the featured ingredient (mushrooms)! Really?! We came in at their opening time on a Saturday. How is that possible? I still went ahead with the order inspite of this and have to admit the burger tasted great. And that aioli - yum!! \\n\\nHubby had Banh-mi Burger. That was good too, tho a bit overdone for a medium. \\n\\nThe wait staff was wonderfully attentive. Our waitress was friendly and expertly answered all our questions. She gave suggestions right off the bat. I like that.

       "Drive by this place constantly so decided to finally come in.  Let me start off by saying that I love Mozzarella sticks.  And Claim Jumper might have some of the biggest and best around.  I truly enjoyed them.  Too bad I didn't feel the same about the pizza I ordered. \\n\\nI was in fact on my way to a pizza place, but we came here instead.  Need less to say I was in the mood for pizza.  I ordered the pepperoni and sausage and it wasn't good.  The biggest problem I had with it was the that the sausage was chopped into what I could only describe as bacon bits.  I wasn't too thrilled by it.  For me the appetizer was the highlight.  I will be back though, because I hear great things about the chocolate cake, and for the Mozzarella sticks.  Also considering there portions it wasn't pricey at all which is great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "I love prime rib and we had a coupon, so we decided to give this place a try. First off, it wasn't that crowded and with no music playing, it was way too quiet in there. A lot of employees were walking around so it was strange that we had to wait so long before someone came to take our drink order. My water was not cold at all and tasted like tap water and smelled weird. Again, I am a prime rib expert and when my prime rib came, I knew I was in trouble. It looked weird and as soon as I cut in to it and tasted it, I knew I'd been duped. It wasn't prime rib at all! It was cooked to look like prime rib but it tasted and shredded more like pot roast or chuck roast that I use at home when I make shredded beef. I didn't even need a knife because it was falling apart with just the touch of my fork. The au jus was so watered down it was almost clear colored and had zero flavor. I asked for gravy for my mashed potatoes and the waiter put more gravy on my plate than potatoes. The mashed potatoes tasted like watered down instant potatoes. I saw the waiter put a heaping tablespoon of chives on a ladies potato which is ridiculous. He obviously needs retraining. My husband was just as disgusted with his food so we asked the busboy for a box and we took our whole plates of food home for our dogs. The waiter never asked if everything was ok or we would have gone off on him. Shame on this restaurant for trying to sell a different cut of meat as prime rib. Beware of this place. Food and service suck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "Started poorly but everything went better and better as the food got out!\\n\\nI booked a table just for myself during a business trip. Got there a few minutes ahead of schedule and the hostess tried to seat me at the bar (\"are you sure you want a table?\"). Yes, I want a table to eat properly!\\n\\nFinally got a table, towards the back of the restaurant in an area that they were setting up with more tables. Felt like they seated me in the middle of the backstage.\\n\\nI went for the prix fixe menu: salad, 16Oz steak with sauce and two sides and desert. All with bottomless wine pairing. I asked for the dressing to be on the side and no sauce on the steak. I thought the waiter was about to scream and kick me out. He clearly did not like special requests...\\n\\nAnyways, the food came out and was great. The somelier was kind and explained his wine choices. \\n\\nOverall an increadible meal value and awesome food quality.

       "Went here for a dinner with 2 other couples for my hubbies birthday after a CMYE Yelp event. I couldn't decide since the menu is good sized, and everything sounded really good. They have \"Snacks\" around $3 - $5, Appetizers $6-10 and Entrees $10+. I decided on the waitress' recommendation of the Spicy Chicken Sandwich on flat bread with Truffle fires. I guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. My sandwich was AMAZING. I did add avocado to it too! I was stuffed at the end and it wasn't a healthy meal but it wasn't heavy either. I'd definitely go back. Remember if you are ordering mixed drinks to say \"light ice\" or you will get 3\\/4 cup ice and a few drops of alcohol :p                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",

If you want great Mediterranean food in a place where your treated like family, this is the place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "4 stars for great service and providing korean food so close to where I live.  food wasn't fantastic, but it was good enough for the price.  we had ttuk bok ki (which was really good), kimchee fried rich (it was ok) and bibimbap in a hot pot (was decent).   I can see myself becoming a regular.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",
       "Food is great! Only thing I don't like is their weird song and dance they do about your order. Glad they're down to earth, but I don't need you to rap my order me! Dont get me wrong, dude had some skill, but a restaurant isnt the place, just take my money and let me go already. I highly suggest getting extra crispy fries and chicken, its the bomb!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

It kind of just looks like a Mexican bar by the shops, but it is a fantastic restaurant. \\n\\nObviously I had the flautas and they were soooooo good!!! The sauce was like nothing I have ever tasted before and I hope I can find a place in Arizona that has something remotely close to it. \\n\\nMy wife had the tacos with chicken, rice and beans. Everything was delicious!!! I could not believe how much good food we got for the price and their drinks were just as good. \\n\\nThis was the number one surprise find for me after a week in Vegas.

       "We made reservations through open table on the yelp mobile app. No issues, we were seated right away. Unfortunately, I made the reservation for 7:00 and then we ended up eating lunch around 3:00, so we weren't very hungry when we sat down for dinner. Everything was so good, I wish I had room for more sides or maybe a dessert.\\n\\nI ordered the 14oz filet even though I didn't think I could eat it because it was only about four bucks more than the 9oz. It was huge. No way was that thing under a full lb. I ordered it medium expecting a perfect mid rare and that's exactly what I got. Tender, juicy, and delicious. It ranks up there with the best steaks I've ever had. At just under $50, it was almost a bargain when you consider that you normally pay $30 for a filet half the size. The sides are served family style, and the only one we tried was the au gratin potatoes. They were the best I've ever had.\\n\\nService was excellent. Friendly, fast, and very professional.

       "I stopped here for a raw juice and ordered the Wellness Drink with strawberries and protein. OH MY GOD the most delicious raw juice I've EVER TASTED! I've tried every juice bar I see and make my own juices at home but this is #1 on the deliciousness level!\\nThe staff is WONDERFUL! I don't know if it was because I asked for a few extra add-ons but they made so much of my drink that they gave me an extra full cup of it! My lucky day! Of course this isn't typical so don't go asking for free stuff. They were just sweet and genuinely friendly. Kudos to them.\\nYes, it's pricey. I paid $9 for it but it'll fill you up and put so much good in your body. I wish I were rich to have this every day, lol. But I seriously recommend it once in a while to those of us on a budget. You can either spend $9 on something delicious, truly nutritious and feel great about your choicce, or you can go to McDonalds for a cheap snack and feel guilty and crappy afterwards. Your choice! :-)\\n\\nHaven't tried the food but so excited to in the future! I'll definitely be a regular here, so long as my budget allows :-P                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
       "Good ramen. This place is connected to the Bachi Burger, locating the entrance was confusing. But glad we found it. Tako-yaki, fried octopus was a good appetizer. Wasn't too fond of the bacon fried rice, alittle salty to me. My tonkotsu ramen was delicious though. I added a poached egg to it.
