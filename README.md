# Insights of Amazon Echo Reivews

The project is to perform a topic analysis on customer reviews for Amazon Echo. This is to understand what major factors drive positive vs. negative experience. The end goal is to use the insights to help business enhance self-awareness and make better business decisions. This has the potential to be applied to any reviews of any product or service. 

### Project Design: 
Step 1: Clean up datasets and combine two datasets for analysis
Step 2: Break down reviews into positive (>3 rating) and negative sentiment (<3 rating) groups based on ratings 
Step 3: Performed cluster analysis on positive and negatement sentiment groups 
Step 4: If limited informaiton extacted from step 3, perform topic modeling on positive and negatement sentiment groups 

### Tools: 
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Pickle for data storage
- SVD for dimension reducton
- Kmeans for cluster anlysis
- LDA for Topic analysis
- Word Cloud for visualization
 
### Data: 
- Dataset #1: Amazon Alexa Device Reviews: ~3k reviews 
- Dataset #2: Amazon Echo Reviews: ~7k reviews

### Algorithms:
- Cluster Analysis
- Topic Modeling

### Learning and Recommended nextsteps:
- Learned to use cloud computing for large scale data. Worked with AWS and Zeppline and solved technical challenges
- For next steps, possibile to combine cluster analysis with topic modeling to extract more precise informaiton
