# Insights of Amazon Echo Reivews

The project performed a topic analysis on customer reviews for Amazon Echo. This is to extact insights regarding what customer care. The end goal is to use the insights to help business enhance self-awareness and make better business decisions. This can potentially be applied to reviews of any product.

### Project Design: 
Step 1: Clean up datasets and combine two datasets into one for analysis
Step 2: Break down reviews into positive (>3 rating) and negative sentiment (<3 rating) groups based on ratings. 
Step 3: Performed cluster analysis on positive and negatement sentiment groups 
Step 4: If limited informaiton from step 3, perform topic modeling on positive and negatement sentiment groups 

### Tools: 
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Pickle for data storage
- SVD for dimension reducton
- Kmeans for cluster anlysis
- LDA for Topic analysis
- Word Cloud for visualization
 
### Data: 
- Dataset #1: Amazon Alexa Device Reviews: ~3k reviews 
- Dataset #2: Amazon Echo Reviews: ~7k reviews

### Algorithms:
- Cluster Analysis
- Topic Modeling

### Learning and Recommended nextsteps:
- Learned to use cloud computing for large scale data. Worked with AWS and Zeppline and solved technical challenges
- For next steps, possibility to combine cluster analysis with topic modeling to extract more precise informaiton
